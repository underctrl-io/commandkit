title: Custom Events
---

CommandKit also supports using custom events in the `events`
directory. Custom events must be defined in a namespaced directory,
which are primarily handled by plugins.

For example, if you have a plugin that is handling a custom event
called `"guildMemberBoost"` under a namespace called `"custom"`, you
can create a file in the `src/app/events/(custom)/guildMemberBoost`
directory which will be handled by the appropriate plugin.

The `"custom"` namespace above is just an example. Namespaces will
generally be set by plugins, so make sure to check the plugin's
documentation for the correct one.

<Callout type="error" title="Danger">
Event namespace directories are **not** the same as
[command categories](../02-commands/06-category-directory.mdx).

## How plugins execute namespaced events

If you're developing a plugin, you can trigger a custom event in your
application. Here's an example of how you can trigger a custom
`guildMemberBoost` event under the `custom` namespace.

```ts
commandkit.events.to('custom').emit('guildMemberBoost', {
  member: member,
  guild: guild,
});
```

This will ensure every file inside the
`src/app/events/(custom)/guildMemberBoost` directory is executed just
like regular [Discord.js events](./01-discordjs-events.mdx)
