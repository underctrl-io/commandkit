## app.ts

The `src/app.ts` (or `app.js`) is a special file that acts as the
entry point for your application. It is where you define and export
your `Discord.js` client instance.

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { Client } from 'discord.js';

const client = new Client({
  /* options */
});

// Optional: Override the default DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable
client.token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN';

export default client;
```

## +middleware.ts

The `src/app/commands/+middleware.ts` (or `+middleware.js`) file is
used to define middleware functions for your application. Middleware
functions get called before and after the command execution.

```ts title="src/app/commands/+middleware.ts"
import { MiddlewareContext } from 'commandkit';

export function beforeExecute(context: MiddlewareContext) {
  // This function will be executed before the command is executed
  console.log('Before command execution');
}

export function afterExecute(context: MiddlewareContext) {
  // This function will be executed after the command is executed
  console.log('After command execution');
}
```

There are 3 types of middlewares you can create:

- `+middleware.ts` (or `+middleware.js`): This file is used to define
  middleware functions that will be executed for all sibling commands
  in the application.
- `+<command>.middleware.ts` (or `+<command>.middleware.js`): This
  file is used to define middleware functions that will be executed
  for a specific command in the application. The `<command>` part of
  the filename should match the name of the command file. This is
  useful for defining middleware functions that should be applied to a
  specific command.
- `+global-middleware.ts` (or `+global-middleware.js`): This file is
  used to define middleware functions that will be executed for all
  commands in the application, regardless of their location in the
  file system.

## (category) directory

In your commands directory, you can create a category using
parenthesis (e.g. `(Moderation)`). This is useful for organizing your
commands into logical groups, making it easier to manage and maintain
your code.

```
src/app/commands/
├── (Moderation)
│   ├── ban.ts
│   ├── kick.ts
│   ├── mute.ts
│   ├── unmute.ts
│   ├── warn.ts
│   ├── warn-list.ts
│   └── warn-remove.ts
```
