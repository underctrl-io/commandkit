CommandKit was created to make Discord.js more beginner friendly by eliminating the need for boilerplate code and making it easier to handle commands and events. It also provides a few other features that make it easier to develop and maintain your Discord.js applications.

If you're planning to create a large scale Discord bot, CommandKit may work for you, but it's probably not the best choice. For large scale applications it's recommended to either build on top of this library or use something else entirely. This library is mainly aimed to be used in small-medium sized projects.
