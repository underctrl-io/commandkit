    commandkit: CommandKit;
    command: {
    /**

     * This can be a ChatInputCommandInteraction, AutocompleteInteraction, or ContextMenuCommandInteraction.
     */
    interaction?:
      | ChatInputCommandInteraction
      | AutocompleteInteraction
      | ContextMenuCommandInteraction;
    /**
     * The message object if the command was invoked via a message.
     */

     * The guild where the command was invoked, if applicable.
     * This will be null for commands invoked in DMs.
     */
    guild: Guild | null;
    /**
     * The channel where the command was invoked.
     * This can be a text channel, DM channel, or any other type of text-based channel.
     */
    channel: TextBasedChannel | null;
    /**
     * The loaded command instance that is being executed.
     * This contains the command's metadata and logic.
     */
    command: LoadedCommand;
  };
    event: null;
