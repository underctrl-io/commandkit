<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/commandkit/src/flags/feature-flags.ts" sourceLine="150" packageName="commandkit" />

Context for evaluating event flags in CommandKit.

```ts title="Signature"
interface EventFlagContext {
    client: Client<true>;
    commandkit: CommandKit;
    event: {
    /**
     * The parsed event data, which contains the raw data from the event.
     * This can include information like user IDs, channel IDs, and other relevant data.
     */
    data: ParsedEvent;
    /**
     * The name of the event being processed.
     * This is the string identifier for the event, such as 'messageCreate' or 'guildMemberAdd'.
     */
    event: string;
    /**
     * The namespace of the event, if applicable.
     * This can be used to group related events or commands together.
     * It is null if the event does not belong to a specific namespace.
     */
    namespace: string | null;
    /**
     * The arguments passed to the event handler.
     * This is an array of arguments that were passed when the event was triggered.
     * It can be used to access specific data related to the event.
     */
    arguments: any[];
    /**
     * A function to retrieve the arguments for a specific event type.
     * This allows for type-safe access to the arguments based on the event name.
     * @param event - The name of the event to retrieve arguments for.
     */
    argumentsAs<E extends keyof ClientEvents>(event: E): ClientEvents[E];
  };
    command: null;
}

The event context, which includes information about the event being processed.
This can include the parsed event data, the event name, and the namespace if applicable.
### command

<MemberInfo kind="property" type={`null`}   />

The command context is null for event flags, as they are not tied to a specific command.
This is used to differentiate between command and event flags.
