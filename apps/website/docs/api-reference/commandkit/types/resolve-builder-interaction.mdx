## ResolveBuilderInteraction

<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/commandkit/src/components/interactive/select-menu/SelectMenu.ts" sourceLine="69" packageName="commandkit" />

Type that resolves to the specific interaction type based on the builder type.
This is used to ensure that the interaction type matches the builder type.
For example, if the builder is a StringSelectMenuKit, the interaction type will be StringSelectMenuInteraction.
If the builder is a UserSelectMenuKit, the interaction type will be UserSelectMenuInteraction, and so on.

```ts title="Signature"
type ResolveBuilderInteraction<T> = T extends StringSelectMenuKit
  ? StringSelectMenuInteraction
  : T extends UserSelectMenuKit
    ? UserSelectMenuInteraction
    : T extends RoleSelectMenuKit
      ? RoleSelectMenuInteraction
      : T extends ChannelSelectMenuKit
        ? ChannelSelectMenuInteraction
        : T extends MentionableSelectMenuKit
          ? MentionableSelectMenuInteraction
          : never
```
