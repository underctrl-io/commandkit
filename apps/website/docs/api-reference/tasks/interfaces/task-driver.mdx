## TaskDriver

<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/tasks/src/driver.ts" sourceLine="33" packageName="@commandkit/tasks" />

Interface for task persistence and scheduling drivers.

Drivers handle the actual scheduling, persistence, and execution timing of tasks.
Different drivers can provide different persistence mechanisms (in-memory, database, etc.)
and scheduling capabilities.



*Example*

```ts
import { TaskDriver } from '@commandkit/tasks';

class CustomDriver implements TaskDriver {
  async create(task: TaskData): Promise<string> {
    // Schedule the task in your system
    const id = await this.scheduler.schedule(task);
    return id;
  }

  async delete(task: string): Promise<void> {
    // Remove the task from your system
    await this.scheduler.cancel(task);
  }

  async setTaskRunner(runner: TaskRunner): Promise<void> {
    // Set up the execution handler
    this.runner = runner;
  }
}
```

```ts title="Signature"
interface TaskDriver {
    create(task: TaskData): Promise<string>;
    delete(task: string): Promise<void>;
    setTaskRunner(runner: TaskRunner): Promise<void>;
}
```

<div className="members-wrapper">

### create

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`(task: <a href='/docs/next/api-reference/tasks/interfaces/task-data#taskdata'>TaskData</a>) => Promise&#60;string&#62;`}   />

Creates a new scheduled task.

This method should schedule the task according to its schedule configuration
and return a unique identifier that can be used to delete the task later.
Multiple tasks may be created with the same name.
### delete

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`(task: string) => Promise&#60;void&#62;`}   />

Deletes a scheduled task by its identifier.

This method should remove the task from the scheduling system and cancel
any pending executions. If the task doesn't exist, this method should
complete successfully without throwing an error.
### setTaskRunner

<MemberInfo kind="method" type={`(runner: <a href='/docs/next/api-reference/tasks/types/task-runner#taskrunner'>TaskRunner</a>) => Promise&#60;void&#62;`}   />

Sets the task execution runner function.

This method should store the provided runner function and call it whenever
a task is due for execution. The runner function receives the task execution
data and should handle any errors that occur during execution.
