## TaskExecutionData

<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/tasks/src/types.ts" sourceLine="73" packageName="@commandkit/tasks" />

Data structure passed to task execution handlers.

This includes the task metadata and execution timestamp, but excludes
scheduling information since the task is already being executed.

```ts title="Signature"
type TaskExecutionData = Omit<
  TaskData,
  'schedule' | 'immediate' | 'timezone'
> & {
  /** Unix timestamp when the task execution started */
  timestamp: number;
}
```
