title: Using CommandKit CLI
description:
  Learn how to use CommandKit CLI to start, build, and manage your
  Discord bot application with comprehensive examples and best
  practices.
---

CommandKit CLI is a powerful tool that streamlines the development and
deployment of your Discord bot application. It provides essential
features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), automatic crash recovery,
and TypeScript support out of the box.

## Getting Started

To view all available CLI commands, run the following in your project
directory:

```sh
npx commandkit --help
```

You'll see a list of available commands and options:

```sh
Usage: commandkit [options] [command]

Options:
  -h, --help               display help for command

Commands:
  dev [options]            Start your bot in development mode.
  start [options]          Start your bot in production mode after running the build command.
  build [options]          Build your project for production usage.
  create [options] <name>  Create new commands, events, or locale files
  help [command]           display help for command
```

## Core Commands

### Development Mode (`commandkit dev`)

The development mode is optimized for local development with features
like:

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Automatically reloads your bot
  when you make changes to commands or events
- **TypeScript Support**: Built-in TypeScript compilation and type
  checking
- **Environment Variables**: Automatic loading of `.env` files
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and stack traces

Example usage:

```sh
# Start development server
npx commandkit dev
```

### Production Build (`commandkit build`)

Creates an optimized production build of your bot application with:

- **TypeScript Compilation**: Converts TypeScript to JavaScript
- **Type Checking**: Validates your code for type errors
- **Code Optimization**: Minifies and optimizes your code
- **Output Directory**: Builds to `dist/` by default

Configuration options in `commandkit.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';

export default defineConfig({
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true, // skip type checking
  },
});
```

### Production Mode (`commandkit start`)

Runs your bot in production mode. Always run `commandkit build` first.

```sh
# Build and start in production
npx commandkit build
npx commandkit start
```

### File Generation (`commandkit create`)

Quickly scaffold new files in your project:

```sh
# Create a new command
npx commandkit create command ping

# Create a new event
npx commandkit create event ready
```

## Best Practices

1. **Development Workflow**:
   - Use `commandkit dev` during development for instant feedback
   - Enable debug mode when troubleshooting issues
   - Keep your `.env` file updated with all required variables

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Always run `commandkit build` before deploying
   - Test the production build locally before deployment
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data

3. **TypeScript Usage**:
   - Enable strict type checking in development
   - Use type annotations for better code quality
   - Consider using `ignoreBuildErrors` only in specific cases

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Build Errors**: Check TypeScript configuration and type
  definitions
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env` file exists and contains
  required variables
- **Hot Reload Issues**: Verify file paths and module exports. Hot
  reload only works for commands, events and the paths supported by
  the active plugins. Changes made to other paths will trigger full
  reload.

For more detailed information about specific commands and options,
use:

```sh
npx commandkit help <command>
```
