# Action Row

The ActionRow component is a container that groups interactive
components like buttons and select menus together in a single row. In
Discord, you can have up to 5 components in a single row.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { ActionRow, Button } from 'commandkit';

const row = (
  <ActionRow>
    <Button>Click me!</Button>
    <Button>Another button</Button>
  </ActionRow>
);
```

## With Select Menus

```tsx
import {
  ActionRow,
  StringSelectMenu,
  StringSelectMenuOption,
} from 'commandkit';

const row = (
  <ActionRow>
    <StringSelectMenu>
      <StringSelectMenuOption label="Option 1" value="1" />
      <StringSelectMenuOption label="Option 2" value="2" />
    </StringSelectMenu>
  </ActionRow>
);
```

## Important Notes

- You can have up to 5 components in a single ActionRow
