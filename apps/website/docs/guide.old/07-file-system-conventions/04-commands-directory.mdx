title: Commands Directory
description:
  The commands directory is used to define the commands for your
  application.
---

The `src/app/commands` directory is where you define the commands for
your application. Each command is defined in its own file, and the
file name should match the command name. For example, if you have a
command called `ping`, you should create a file called `ping.ts` (or
`ping.js`) in the `src/app/commands` directory.

:::info Plugins can register external commands, which may be located
in a different directory. For more information, see the
[Plugins](../06-plugins/03-creating-a-runtime-plugin.mdx) section. As
an example, the
[legacy plugin](../06-plugins/official-plugins/03-legacy.mdx) can
register commands from custom directories. :::
