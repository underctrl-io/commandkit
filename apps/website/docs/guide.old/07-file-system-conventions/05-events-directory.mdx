title: Events Directory
description: The events directory is used to define the events for your Discord.js application.
---

CommandKit provides a special directory called `events` inside the `src/app` directory. This directory is used to define the events for your Discord.js application. Each event is defined in its own directory, and the directory name should match the Discord.js event name. Inside each event directory, you can create multiple function files that will be executed when the event is triggered. For example, if you have an event called `messageCreate`, you should create a directory called `messageCreate` in the `src/app/events` directory, and place your event handler functions inside it.

```
.
└── src/
    └── app/
        └── events/
            ├── messageCreate/
            │   ├── give-xp.ts
            │   └── log.ts
            └── ready/
                ├── log.ts
                └── initialize.ts
```

## Custom events

CommandKit also supports using custom events in the `events` directory. Custom events must be defined in a namespaced directory, which are handled by the active plugins. For example, if you have a custom event called `guildMemberBoost`, you can create a file called `src/app/events/(custom)/guildMemberBoost/handler.ts` which will be handled by the appropriate active plugins.

:::info
Event namespace directories are not same as [category directories](./03-category-directory.mdx) as they serve a different purpose.
:::

You can use the custom events the same way as the built-in events. The only difference is that these events are namespaced and are handled by the plugins.

## How plugins execute namespaced events

The following example shows how you can trigger a custom event in your application. The `guildMemberBoost` event under the `custom` namespace is triggered when a user boosts the server.

```ts
commandkit.events.to('custom').emit('guildMemberBoost', {
  member: member,
  guild: guild,
});
```
