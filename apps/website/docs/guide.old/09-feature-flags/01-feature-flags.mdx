Feature flags are a powerful tool for controlling the visibility of
features in your application. They allow you to enable or disable
features for specific users or groups, making it easier to test and
roll out new functionality. This is particularly useful to perform A/B
testing, gradual rollouts, and canary releases.

CommandKit natively offers a feature flag system that allows you to
define flags in your configuration and use them in your code. This
system is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing you to easily
manage feature flags across your application.

## Possible Use Cases

- **Maintenance Mode**: You can use feature flags to enable or disable
  features in your application during maintenance. This allows you to
  perform maintenance tasks without affecting the user experience.
- **A/B Testing**: You can use feature flags to test different
  versions of a feature with different users. For example, you can
  show one version of a button to 50% of users and another version to
  the other 50%.
- **Gradual Rollouts**: You can use feature flags to gradually roll
  out a new feature to a small percentage of users before rolling it
  out to everyone. This allows you to monitor the feature's
  performance and make adjustments as needed.
- **Canary Releases**: You can use feature flags to release a new
  feature to a small group of users before rolling it out to everyone.
  This allows you to test the feature in a production environment and
  catch any issues before they affect all users.
- **Feature Toggles**: You can use feature flags to enable or disable
  features in your application without deploying new code. This allows
  you to quickly turn features on or off as needed.
- **User Segmentation**: You can use feature flags to enable or
  disable features for specific users or groups. This allows you to
  customize the user experience based on user preferences or behavior.
- **Testing and Debugging**: You can use feature flags to enable or
  disable features for testing and debugging purposes. This allows you
  to isolate issues and test specific features without affecting the
  entire application.

## Defining Feature Flags

Feature flags may be defined in any file in your project (except
`app.ts`). The recommended place to define them is in `src/flags`
directory.

```ts title="src/flags/embedColorFlag.ts"
import { flag } from 'commandkit';
import murmurhash from 'murmurhash';

export const embedColorFlag = flag({
  name: 'embed-color-flag',
  description: 'Show red color instead of blue in embeds',
  identify(ctx) {
    const command = ctx.command;
    const id =
      command?.interaction?.user.id ?? command?.message?.author.id;

    return { id: id ?? null };
  },
  decide({ entities }) {
    if (!entities.id) {
      // if no ID is provided, we cannot determine the feature flag
      // so fall back to the default behavior
      return false;
    }

    // use murmurhash to hash the ID and determine the bucket
    // this allows us to have a consistent way to determine the feature flag
    // based on the user ID, so that the same user will always see the same feature flag
    // this is useful for A/B testing, where you want to show the same feature to the same user
    // without changing it every time they use the command
    // you can use any other hashing function or logic here as needed
    const hash = murmurhash.v3(entities.id);
    const bucket = hash % 100;

    // show red color instead of blue in embeds
    // to 50% of users, based on their ID
    // this is a simple A/B test
    // you can use any other logic here
    return bucket < 50;
  },
});
```

## Using Feature Flags

Once you have defined a feature flag, you can use it in your code to
control the visibility of features. You can use the function returned
by the `flag` function to check if a feature flag is enabled or not.

```ts title="src/commands/hello.ts"
import { ChatInputCommand, CommandData } from 'commandkit';
import { embedColorFlag } from '../flags/embedColorFlag';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'hello',
  description: 'Hello world command',
};

export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
  const showRedColor = await embedColorFlag();

  await ctx.interaction.reply({
    embeds: [
      {
        title: 'Hello world',
        description: 'This is a hello world command',
        color: showRedColor ? 0xff0000 : 0x0000ff,
      },
    ],
  });
};
```

Now there's a 50% chance that the embed will be red instead of blue.
You can use this feature flag to test the new color scheme with a
subset of users before rolling it out to everyone.

## Collecting analytics

You may want to see how many users are using a specific feature flag.
You can do this by using the `analytics` plugin of CommandKit, which
automatically collects the analytics data in the background whenever
the feature flags are used. See
[Analytics in CommandKit](../10-analytics/01-analytics-in-commandkit.mdx)
guide for more information on how to set it up.

## Context Identification

Sometimes you may want to identify specific users or groups for
feature flags. For example, you may want to show a secret feature to
server boosters only. In order to identify the context of the flag,
you can add the `identify` method to the flag definition.

```ts title="src/flags/embedColorFlag.ts"
import { flag } from 'commandkit';
import { GuildMember } from 'discord.js';

interface Entity {
  isBooster: boolean;
}

export const embedColorFlag = flag<boolean, Entity>({
  key: 'embed-color-flag',
  description: 'Show red color instead of blue in embeds',
  identify(ctx) {
    let member: GuildMember | null = null;

    if (ctx.command) {
      member = (ctx.command.interaction || ctx.command.message)
        ?.member as GuildMember;
    } else if (ctx.event) {
      // handle event specific context
      if (ctx.event.event === 'guildMemberUpdate') {
        const [_oldMember, newMember] = ctx.event.argumentsAs(
          'guildMemberUpdate',
        );

        member = newMember as GuildMember;
      }
    }

    return { isBooster: member?.premiumSince !== null };
  },
  decide({ entities }) {
    return entities.isBooster;
  },
});
```

:::info **Understanding Flag Context** Feature flags are
**context-aware**, meaning they automatically detect and provide the
necessary context (like user information, guild data, etc.) when used
within CommandKit's execution environment.

**Automatic Context Detection:**

- ✅ **Commands** - Flags automatically access interaction/message
  data
- ✅ **Events** - Flags automatically access event-specific data
- ✅ **Middlewares** - Flags automatically access the current
  execution context

**Manual Context Required:** If you need to use flags outside of these
contexts (e.g., in utility functions, background jobs, or external API
handlers), you must manually provide the identification data:

```ts
// Option 1: Pass values directly
const result = await myFlag.run({ identify: { isBooster: true } });

// Option 2: Pass as a function (useful for dynamic values)
const result = await myFlag.run({
  identify: () => ({ isBooster: user.premiumSince !== null }),
});
```

**Best Practice:** Keep flag usage within commands, events, and
middlewares whenever possible. Manual context passing should only be
used when absolutely necessary, as it bypasses the automatic context
detection which causes flags to be less efficient and more
error-prone. :::
