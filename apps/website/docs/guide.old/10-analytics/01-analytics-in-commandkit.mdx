# Analytics in CommandKit

The analytics plugin for CommandKit enables analytics in your project.
It provides a simple and efficient way to track events and metrics.
CommandKit itself does not store any analytics data - it acts as a
bridge between your application and your chosen analytics provider.

## How it Works

CommandKit's analytics system is designed to be provider-agnostic.
This means:

1. CommandKit doesn't store any analytics data itself
2. All data is sent directly to your configured analytics provider
3. You can easily switch between different providers or use multiple
   providers
4. The system is extensible, allowing you to create custom providers

## Automatic Tracking

CommandKit automatically tracks various anonymous metrics:

- Command execution events (`command_execution`)
- Cache performance metrics:
  - Cache hits (`cache_hit`)
  - Cache misses (`cache_miss`)
  - Cache revalidations (`cache_revalidated`)
- Feature flag metrics:
  - Feature flag metrics (`feature_flag_metrics`)
  - Feature flag decisions (`feature_flag_decision`)
- Anonymous interaction patterns

## Installation

```sh
npm install @commandkit/analytics
```

## Basic Usage

To track custom events in your Discord bot:

```ts
import { track } from 'commandkit/analytics';

// Track a custom event with anonymous data
await track({
  name: 'button_interaction',
  data: {
    buttonType: 'verification',
    // Use hashed or anonymous identifiers if needed
    interactionType: 'button',
    // Track timing for performance metrics
    responseTime: 150,
  },
});
```

## Filtering Events

You can filter out specific events using the `setFilter` function:

```ts
import { useAnalytics } from 'commandkit/analytics';

const analytics = useAnalytics();

// Filter out events based on anonymous criteria
analytics.setFilter((engine, event) => {
  // Skip events from development environments
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    return false; // false means skip this event
  }

  // Skip specific event types
  if (event.name === 'debug_event') {
    return false;
  }

  return true; // true means track this event
});
```

## Available Providers

CommandKit comes with built-in support for popular analytics
providers:

- [PostHog](./02-posthog.mdx)
- [Umami](./03-umami.mdx)

## Creating Custom Providers

You can create your own analytics provider by implementing the
`AnalyticsProvider` interface. See our
[Custom Providers](./04-custom-providers.mdx) guide for detailed
instructions.

## Disabling Analytics

You can disable analytics for specific requests (i.e. command or event
scoped) using the `noAnalytics` function:

```ts
import { noAnalytics } from 'commandkit/analytics';

// Disable analytics for specific commands or events
if (interaction.commandName === 'debug') {
  noAnalytics();
}
```

## Privacy Considerations

When implementing analytics in your bot, consider:

1. Only track anonymous, aggregated data
2. Avoid storing personal information
3. Use hashed identifiers when necessary
4. Be transparent about what data you collect
5. Respect user privacy and Discord's Terms of Service
