## Creating AI commands

AI commands can be created by exporting a function called `ai` from
your regular command file. You can also export `aiConfig` object along
with the `ai` function to specify the parameters for the command.

The `ai` function behaves similar to a `message` command, but it
receives an additional `ctx.ai` property (which is an instance of
[`AiContext`](../../api-reference/ai/classes/ai-context.mdx)) that
contains the parameters passed by the AI model.

```typescript title="src/app/commands/balance.ts"
import { ApplicationCommandOptionType } from 'discord.js';
import { CommandData, ChatInputCommand } from 'commandkit';
import { AiConfig, AiCommand } from '@commandkit/ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'balance',
  description: 'Get the current balance of the user.',
  options: [
    {
      name: 'user',
      description: 'The user to get the balance for.',
      type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.User,
    },
  ],
};

export const aiConfig: AiConfig = {
  parameters: z.object({
    userId: z
      .string()
      .describe('The ID of the user to get the balance of'),
  }),
};

export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
  const { interaction } = ctx;
  const user = interaction.options.getUser('user');
  const balance = await db.getBalance(user.id);

  await interaction.reply({
    content: `The balance of ${user.username} is ${balance}`,
  });
};

// AI will call this function to get the balance of the user
export const ai: AiCommand<typeof aiConfig> = async (ctx) => {
  const { userId } = ctx.ai.params;
  const balance = await db.getBalance(userId);

  // return object with the balance
  return {
    userId,
    balance,
  };
};
```

Now, you can simply mention the bot in a message to get the balance of
the user. Eg:

```text
@bot what is the balance of @user?
```

AI can also call multiple commands in a single message. Eg:

```text
@bot show me the basic details of the user @user and also include the balance of that user.
```

The above prompt will call the built-in `getUserInfo` tool and the
`balance` command.

## Example of AI creating a poll

This is an example of how AI can create a poll using the `createPoll`
command. The AI will generate a poll based on the user's input.
