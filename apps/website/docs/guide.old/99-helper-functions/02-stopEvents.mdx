The `stopEvents()` function is a utility function that allows you to stop the execution of the events chain in CommandKit. This is useful when you want to prevent further event handlers from being executed after a certain point.
It is typically used in the context of event handlers to control the flow of execution.

## Usage

```ts title="./src/app/events/messageCreate/event.ts"
import { stopEvents } from 'commandkit';
import { Message } from 'discord.js';

export default async function onMessageCreate(message: Message) {
  console.log('Message received:', message.content);

  // Stop further event handlers of messageCreate from being executed after this point
  stopEvents();
  // code below will not be executed
}
```

:::info
You must not call `stopEvents()` in try-catch block, otherwise it will not work as expected.
