  Setup a new CommandKit project using the create-commandkit CLI
---

:::info

- CommandKit requires at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v24
- This documentation assumes that you have a basic understanding of
  how to use [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). If you are new to
  discord.js, we recommend you to read the
  [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/) first.

:::

The quickest way to setup a new CommandKit project is to use the
`create-commandkit` CLI. To get started, run the following command in
your terminal:

```sh npm2yarn
npm create commandkit@next
```

This will start the CLI in an interactive mode. You can follow the
prompts to setup your project.

## Project structure

By using the CLI to create a base project, you should get a file tree
that looks something like this:

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── commands/
│   │   │   └── ping.ts
│   │   └── events/
│   │       └── ready/
│   │           └── log.ts
│   └── app.ts
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── commandkit.config.ts
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Entry point

The `src/app.ts` file is the main entry point for your application.
This file default exports the discord.js client instance which
CommandKit loads at runtime.

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { Client } from 'discord.js';

const client = new Client({
  intents: ['Guilds', 'GuildMessages', 'MessageContent'],
});

// Optional: Setting up the token manually
client.token = process.env.MY_BOT_TOKEN;

export default client;
```

Notice how there's no `client.login()` in this file. This is because
CommandKit will automatically handle the login process for you when
the application starts.

## Development version

If you would like to try the latest development builds, you can use
the `@dev` tag like so:

```sh npm2yarn
npm create commandkit@dev
```

:::warning

The development version is likely to have bugs.

## Manual setup

Alternatively, if you would like to setup a new CommandKit project
manually, you can follow
[this guide](../08-advanced/01-setup-commandkit-manually.mdx).
