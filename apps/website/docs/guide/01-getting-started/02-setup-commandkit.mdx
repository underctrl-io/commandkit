title: Setup CommandKit
description: Setup a new CommandKit project manually, or using the create-commandkit CLI
---

You can quickly setup a new CommandKit project using `create-commandkit` — a command-line utility used for creating new discord.js applications with CommandKit. To get started, run the following command:

```sh npm2yarn
npx create-commandkit@latest
```

This will start the CLI in the current directory which will help you quickly setup a base CommandKit project.

## Project structure

By using the CLI to create a base project, you should get a project structure that looks like this:

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── commands/
│   │   │   └── ping.ts
│   │   └── events/
│   │       └── ready/
│   │           └── log.ts
│   └── app.ts
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── commandkit.config.ts
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

:::info
The `src/app.ts` file is the main entry point for your application. This file default exports the discord.js client which commandkit loads at runtime. For example, the `src/app.ts` file looks like this:

```ts
import { Client } from 'discord.js';

const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    /* add stuff */
  ],
});

// setting up the token manually
client.token = process.env.MY_BOT_TOKEN;

export default client;
```

Notice how we are not calling `client.login()` in this file. This is because commandkit will automatically call `client.login()` for you when the application starts.

Also, you might have noticed that we are not using anything from commandkit in this file. This is because commandkit is designed to reduce boilerplate code and make it easier to build discord bot applications.

:::info
The `src/app` directory is a special directory that commandkit understands. All the commands and events in this directory will be automatically registered when the application starts.

## Development version

:::warning
The development version is likely to have bugs.
:::

If you'd like to try the latest development builds, you can use the `@dev` tag like so:

```sh npm2yarn
npx create-commandkit@dev
```
