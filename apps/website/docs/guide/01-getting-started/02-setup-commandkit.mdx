title: Setup CommandKit
description: Setup a new CommandKit project manually, or using the create-commandkit CLI
---

You can quickly setup a new CommandKit project using `create-commandkit` — a command-line utility used for creating new discord.js applications with CommandKit. To get started, run the following command:

```sh npm2yarn
npx create-commandkit@latest
```

This will start the CLI in the current directory which will help you quickly setup a base CommandKit project.

## Project structure

By using the CLI to create a base project, you should get a project structure that looks like this:

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── commands/
│   │   │   └── ping.ts
│   │   └── events/
│   │       └── ready/
│   │           └── log.ts
│   └── app.ts
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── commandkit.config.ts
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Development version

:::warning
The development version is likely to have bugs.
:::

If you'd like to try the latest development builds, you can use the `@dev` tag like so:

```sh npm2yarn
npx create-commandkit@dev
```
