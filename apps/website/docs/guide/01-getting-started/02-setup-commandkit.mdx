title: Setup CommandKit
description: Setup a new CommandKit project manually, or using the create-commandkit CLI
---

You can quickly setup a new CommandKit project using `create-commandkit` â€” a command-line utility used for creating new discord.js applications with CommandKit. To get started, run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npx create-commandkit@latest
```

This will start the CLI in the current directory which will help you quickly setup a base CommandKit project.

## Development version

If you'd like to try the latest development builds, you can use the `@dev` tag when setting up a CommandKit project using the CLI.

:::warning
The development version is likely to have bugs.
:::

```bash npm2yarn
npx create-commandkit@dev
```
