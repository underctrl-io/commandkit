import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

If you don't want to use the CLI to automatically generate a base CommandKit project, you can integrate CommandKit manually into your application.

:::info
While this guide primarily uses TypeScript, you can alternatively use JavaScript files to follow along if that's what you're comfortable with (e.g. `commandkit.config.js`, `app.js`, etc)
:::

## Configuration file

To get started, create a file called `commandkit.config.ts` at the root of your project. This file is used to configure CommandKit and its plugins.

```ts title="commandkit.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';

export default defineConfig({});
```

## Entrypoint file

Then, create a folder called `src`, followed by a file called `app.ts` inside it. The file should look like this:

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { Client } from 'discord.js';

const client = new Client({
  intents: ['Guilds', 'GuildMembers'],
});

// must export the `client` here
export default client;
```

With the current entrypoint file created, it's important to understand that:

1. The `app.ts` file is the entrypoint for this application. This file **must** export your discord.js client instance.
2. You don't have to call `client.login()` as CommandKit will handle that for you.
3. You should store your bot token as an environment variable with either `DISCORD_TOKEN` or `TOKEN` as the name.

## Adding commands

To add a command, create a folder inside the `src/app` directory called `commands` and create your command file (e.g. `ping.ts`). This example will use a simple ping/pong command which will register as a chat input (slash) and message (legacy) command.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import type { SlashCommand, CommandData, MessageCommand } from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Pong!',
};

export const chatInput: SlashCommand = async ({ interaction }) => {
  await interaction.reply('Pong!');
};

export const message: MessageCommand = async ({ message }) => {
  await message.reply('Pong!');
};
```

This command will reply with "Pong!" when the user runs the `/ping` slash command, or sends `!ping` in the chat.

:::tip
Prefixes for your message (legacy) commands can be changed. Learn more [here](/docs/next/guide/resolve-message-commands-prefix).
:::

## Running the app in development

To run your application in development mode, you can use the `commandkit dev` command in your terminal. This will automatically reload the bot when you make changes to your code.

```sh npm2yarn
npx commandkit dev
```

:::warning
When running in development mode, CommandKit will generate a `.commandkit` folder in the root of your project. This folder contains the compiled files used in development mode. You should not commit this folder to your version control system by making sure you add it to your `.gitignore` file.
:::

## Building for production

When you are ready to deploy your bot, you can use `commandkit build` to create a production build of your bot. This will create a `dist` folder in your project directory containing the compiled files.

```sh
npx commandkit build
```

:::warning
After running your build script, CommandKit will generate a `.dist` folder in the root of your project. This folder contains the compiled files used for production. You should not commit this folder to your version control system by making sure you add it to your `.gitignore` file.
:::

## Running the app in production

You can use `commandkit start` to start the bot in production mode. This will load the environment variables from the `.env` file in the root of your project directory.

```sh
npx commandkit start
```

If you want to manually start the bot in production mode, you can alternatively use the following command:

```sh
node dist/index.js
```

:::warning
Directives such as `'use cache'` will **NOT** work when you manually start your bot (e.g. `node dist/index.js`). For directives to work, you must use the CommandKit CLI to run the application in development and production.
