title: Chat input commands
---

CommandKit provides a very simple way to manage your chat input
(slash) commands, including registering them to the Discord API, as
well as handling their execution.

To create a new chat input command, create a new file in the
`src/app/commands` directory with the name of the command. This guide
will create a basic ping command which will respond with "Pong!" when
executed.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import type { CommandData, ChatInputCommand } from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Replies with Pong!',
};

export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.interaction.reply('Pong!');
};
```

## Exports explained

### `command`

This is the command data object which defines the shape of your
command. This is directly registered to the Discord API everytime your
commands are refreshed.

### `chatInput`

This is the main handler function for your chat input command. By
exporting this function, CommandKit will know that it's a chat input
command and will register and handle it accordingly.

:::tip Chat input commands are just one of the command types that
CommandKit supports. Learn more about
[message commands](./04-message-commands.mdx) and
[context menu commands](./03-context-menu-commands.mdx). :::

## Guild-based commands

You can register your chat input command to specific guilds by using
the `guilds` property in the `command` object which accepts an array
of guild IDs.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts" {6}
import type { CommandData } from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Replies with Pong!',
  guilds: ['1055188344188973066'],
};
```
