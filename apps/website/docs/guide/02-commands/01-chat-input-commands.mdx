title: Chat Input Commands

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

Chat input commands, more commonly known as 'Slash Commands', are a
way for users on Discord to perform actions using your bot.

CommandKit provides a very simple way to manage your chat input
commands, including registering them to the Discord API, as well as
handling their execution.

To create a new chat input command, create a new file in the
`src/app/commands` directory with the name of the command. This guide
will create a basic ping command which will respond with "Pong!" when
executed.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
    import type { CommandData, ChatInputCommand } from 'commandkit';

    export const command: CommandData = {
      name: 'ping',
      description: 'Replies with Pong!',
    };

    export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
      await ctx.interaction.reply('Pong!');
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/app/commands/ping.js"
    /**
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').CommandData} CommandData
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').ChatInputCommand} ChatInputCommand
     */

    /** @type {CommandData} */
    export const command = {
      name: 'ping',
      description: 'Replies with Pong!',
    };

    /** @type {ChatInputCommand} */
    export const chatInput = async (ctx) => {
      await ctx.interaction.reply('Pong!');
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Exports explained

### `command`

This is the command data object which defines the shape of your
command. This is directly registered to the Discord API everytime your
commands are refreshed.

### `chatInput`

This is the main handler function for your chat input command. By
exporting this function, CommandKit will know that it's a chat input
command and will register and handle it accordingly.

:::tip

Chat input commands are just one of the command types that CommandKit
supports. Learn more about
[message commands](./04-message-commands.mdx) and
[context menu commands](./03-context-menu-commands.mdx).
