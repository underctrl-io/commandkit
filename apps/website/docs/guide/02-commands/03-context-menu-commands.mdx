title: Context menu commands
---

Context menu commands allows users on Discord to run commands by
either referencing a message or a user. Context menu commands can be
grouped to either 'Message' or 'User' context menu commands.

Alongside chat input commands, you can use CommandKit to also register
and handle context menu commands.

Context menu commands live in the same directory as your chat input
commands. To begin, create a command file in your `src/app/commands`
directory.

This guide will create 2 simple `report-message` and `report-user`
commands. It's not an actual reporting system, but it should make
understanding the nature of these context menu commands easier.

## Message context menu command

```ts title="src/app/commands/report-message.ts"
import type {
  CommandData,
  MessageContextMenuCommand,
} from 'commandkit';
import { MessageFlags } from 'discord.js';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'report-message',
  description: 'Report a message to moderators.',
};

export const messageContextMenu: MessageContextMenuCommand = async ({
  interaction,
}) => {
  const content = interaction.targetMessage.content;

  // you could add your message reporting logic here

  await interaction.reply({
    content: `You have reported the following message: ${content}`,
    flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
  });
};
```

By just exporting the `messageContextMenu` function from your command
file, CommandKit will properly update your command type before
registering it to the Discord API. You don't have to manually set a
`type` in your `command` object, as you would with most command
handlers.

## User context menu command

The logic for registering and handling user context menu commands is
very similar to message context menu commands.

```ts title="src/app/commands/report-user.ts"
import type { CommandData, UserContextMenuCommand } from 'commandkit';
import { MessageFlags } from 'discord.js';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'report-user',
  description: 'Report a user to moderators.',
};

export const userContextMenu: UserContextMenuCommand = async ({
  interaction,
}) => {
  const userId = interaction.targetUser.id;

  // you could add your user reporting logic here

  await interaction.reply({
    content: `You have reported a user with the ID: ${userId}`,
    flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
  });
};
```
