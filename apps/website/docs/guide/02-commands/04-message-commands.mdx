title: Message commands
---

Message commands, which are generally considered 'Legacy', are a way
to run commands on Discord bots using regular messages. Before the
introduction of
[Slash/Chat Input Commands](./01-chat-input-commands.mdx), this was
the primary way commands were handled. They were usually triggered by
using a prefix set by the developer of the bot (for example: `!ping`).

:::warning

While CommandKit allows developers to create and handle message
commands, it's important to note that Discord generally discourages
message commands in favor of the more modern
[Chat Input Commands](./01-chat-input-commands.mdx).

:::

Message commands, like all the other command types, live in your
`src/app/commands` directory. To let CommandKit know that this is a
message command, just export the `messageCommand` function.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import type { CommandData, MessageCommand } from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'ping',
};

export const messageCommand: MessageCommand = async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.message.reply('Pong!');
};
```

:::tip

By default, your bot's prefix will be `!`. However, with CommandKit
you can set custom prefixes, or even guild-based prefixes.

## Message command options (arguments)

Since a message command - on a technical level - is just a string, the
idea of message command options will be different compared to
[chat input command](./01-chat-input-commands.mdx) options. Instead of
getting parsed data, you'll essentially be dealing with string
'arguments'.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import type { CommandData, MessageCommand } from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'ping',
};

export const messageCommand: MessageCommand = async (ctx) => {
  const args = ctx.message.args(); // string[]
};
```

With the above command as an example, if a user on Discord runs
`!ping arg1 arg2 arg3`, the value of `args` will equal
`['arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3']`.
