title: after Function
---

The `after` function allows you to execute a callback after a command
has been executed. This is useful for performing actions that should
occur after the command has completed, such as logging or cleanup
tasks.

## Usage

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import {
  type CommandData,
  type ChatInputCommand,
  after,
} from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {};

export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
  after(() => {
    // This code will be executed after the command has been executed
    console.log('Command has been executed');
  });

  await ctx.interaction.reply({
    content: 'Hello World',
    ephemeral: true,
  });
};
```

:::info

The `after` function is guaranteed to be called after the command has
been executed, regardless of whether the command was successful or
not.
