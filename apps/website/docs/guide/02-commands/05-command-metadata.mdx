title: Command Metadata
---

Command metadata is a way to add additional information to your
commands that CommandKit will handle.

To get started, you can export a `metadata` object from your command:

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts" {8-10}
import type { CommandData, CommandMetadata } from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Replies with Pong!',
};

export const metadata: CommandMetadata = {
  // Add your metadata here
};
```

## Metadata properties

### `userPermissions`

This is a string, or array of user permission strings that will be
required by the person executing the command.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
export const metadata: CommandMetadata = {
  // If the user does not have the Administrator permission, CommandKit will let them know
  userPermissions: 'Administrator',
};
```

### `botPermissions`

This is a string, or array of bot permission strings that will be
required by your bot to execute the command. This is useful for
commands where your bot needs to have certain permissions in a guild
e.g. moderation commands.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
export const metadata: CommandMetadata = {
  // If the bot does not have these permissions, CommandKit will let them know
  botPermissions: ['KickMembers', 'BanMembers'],
};
```

### `guilds`

This is an array of guild IDs that the command will be registered in,
or be available to be executed (message commands).

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
export const metadata: CommandMetadata = {
  guilds: ['1234567890', '1234567891'],
};
```

### `aliases`

This is an array of alternative command names that will be available
for users to use to execute the command.

:::warning

This only works for [message commands](./04-message-commands.mdx).

:::

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
export const metadata: CommandMetadata = {
  aliases: ['p', 'pong'],
};
```

## Generated metadata

If you'd like to generate metadata dynamically, you can export a
`generateMetadata` function from your command file that should return
a `CommandMetadata` object.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import type { CommandMetadataFunction } from 'commandkit';

export const generateMetadata: CommandMetadataFunction = async () => {
  // Dynamically determine the metadata for the command

  return {
    userPermissions: 'Administrator',
    botPermissions: ['KickMembers', 'BanMembers'],
    guilds: ['1234567890', '1234567891'],
    aliases: ['p', 'pong'],
  };
};
```
