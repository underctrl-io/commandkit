title: after Function

:::warning UNSTABLE

The `after()` function is currently marked as unstable and may change
in the future.

:::

The `after()` function allows you to execute a callback after a
command has been executed. This is useful for performing actions that
should occur after the command has completed, such as logging or
cleanup tasks.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
    import {
      type CommandData,
      type ChatInputCommand,
      unstable_after as after,
    } from 'commandkit';

    export const command: CommandData = {};

    export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
      after(() => {
        // This code will be executed after the command has been executed
        // Perform any cleanup here
        console.log('Command has been executed');
      });

      await ctx.interaction.reply({
        content: 'Hello World',
        ephemeral: true,
      });
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/app/commands/ping.js"
    /**
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').CommandData} CommandData
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').ChatInputCommand} ChatInputCommand
     */
    import { unstable_after as after } from 'commandkit';

    /** @type {CommandData} */
    export const command = {};

    /** @type {ChatInputCommand} */
    export const chatInput = async (ctx) => {
      after(() => {
        // This code will be executed after the command has been executed
        // Perform any cleanup here
        console.log('Command has been executed');
      });

      await ctx.interaction.reply({
        content: 'Hello World',
        ephemeral: true,
      });
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

The `after()` function will always be called, regardless of whether
the command execution was successful or not.

:::

## Cancelling the after function

You can cancel the after function by calling the `cancelAfter`
function with the ID of the after function.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
    import {
      unstable_after as after,
      unstable_cancelAfter as cancelAfter,
    } from 'commandkit';

    export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
      const id = after(() => {
        console.log('This will run after the command has finished executing.');
      });

      if (something) {
        cancelAfter(id);
      }
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/app/commands/ping.js"
    /**
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').ChatInputCommand} ChatInputCommand
     */
    import {
      unstable_after as after,
      unstable_cancelAfter as cancelAfter,
    } from 'commandkit';

    /** @type {ChatInputCommand} */
    export const chatInput = async (ctx) => {
      const id = after(() => {
        console.log('This will run after the command has finished executing.');
      });

      if (something) {
        cancelAfter(id);
      }
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
