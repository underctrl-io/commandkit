title: after Function
---

:::warning UNSTABLE

The `after()` function is currently marked as unstable and may change
in the future.

:::

The `after()` function allows you to execute a callback after a
command has been executed. This is useful for performing actions that
should occur after the command has completed, such as logging or
cleanup tasks.

## Usage

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import {
  type CommandData,
  type ChatInputCommand,
  unstable_after as after,
} from 'commandkit';

export const command: CommandData = {};

export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
  after(() => {
    // This code will be executed after the command has been executed
    // Perform any cleanup here
    console.log('Command has been executed');
  });

  await ctx.interaction.reply({
    content: 'Hello World',
    ephemeral: true,
  });
};
```

:::info

The `after()` function will always be called, regardless of whether
the command execution was successful or not.
