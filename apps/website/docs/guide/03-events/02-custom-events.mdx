title: Custom events
---

CommandKit also supports using custom events in the `events`
directory. Custom events must be defined in a namespaced directory,
which are primarily handled by plugins. For example, if you have a
custom event called `guildMemberBoost`, you can create a file called
`src/app/events/(custom)/guildMemberBoost/handler.ts` which will be
handled by the appropriate plugins.

:::info

Event namespace directories are not the same as
[command categories](../02-commands/06-category-directory.mdx) as they
serve a different purpose.

:::

The usage of custom events is the same way as
[Discord.js events](./01-discordjs-events.mdx). The only difference is
that these events are namespaced and are primarily handled by plugins.

## How plugins execute namespaced events

If you're developing a plugin, you can trigger a custom event in your
application. Here's an example of how you can trigger a custom
`guildMemberBoost` event under the `custom` namespace.

```ts
commandkit.events.to('custom').emit('guildMemberBoost', {
  member: member,
  guild: guild,
});
```

This will ensure every file inside the
`src/app/events/(custom)/guildMemberBoost` directory is executed jue
like regular [Discord.js events](./01-discordjs-events.mdx)
