title: stopEvents function
---

The `stopEvents()` function is a utility function that allows you to
stop the execution of the events chain in CommandKit. This is useful
when you want to prevent further event handlers from being executed
after a certain point. It is typically used in the context of event
handlers to control the flow of execution.

## Usage

```ts title="src/app/events/messageCreate/event.ts"
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';
import { stopEvents } from 'commandkit';

export default async function (message: Message) {
  console.log('Message received:', message.content);

  // Stop further event handlers of messageCreate from being executed after this point
  stopEvents();
  // code below will not be executed
}
```

:::warning

Calling `stopEvents()` in a try/catch block may lead to unexpected
behavior.

:::

:::info

At this time, the `stopEvents()` function is only available for
[Discord.js events](./01-discordjs-events.mdx), and not for custom
namespaced events.
