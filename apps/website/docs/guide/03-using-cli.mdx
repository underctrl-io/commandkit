title: Using CommandKit CLI
description: Learn how to use CommandKit CLI to start, build, and manage your bot application.
---

CommandKit CLI allows you to start, build, and manage your bot application. It also includes features such as HMR during development, anti-crash, etc. so you can be rest assured your bot won't crash and go offline during production.

To get a list of the available CLI commands, run the following command inside your project directory:

```sh
npx commandkit --help
```

The output should look something like this:

```sh
Usage: commandkit [options] [command]

Options:
  -h, --help               display help for command

Commands:
  dev [options]            Start your bot in development mode.
  start [options]          Start your bot in production mode after running the build command.
  build [options]          Build your project for production usage.
  create [options] <name>  Create new commands, events, or locale files
  help [command]           display help for command
```

:::info
CommandKit does not perform type checking on your code yet. You need to do that
yourself using `tsc --noEmit` command or any other tool of your choice.

## Available commands

### Build

`commandkit build` creates an optimized production build of your bot application. By default, commandkit emits the build to `dist/` directory in your project. It supports typescript out of the box.

CommandKit also injects anti-crash script in your production build to prevent your bot from crashing due to cases like unhandled promise rejections. Although, it's recommended to handle these cases yourself. You can disable this behavior by setting `antiCrash: false` in your `commandkit.config.js` file.

### Development

`commandkit dev` starts your bot in development mode. It supports hot reloading out of the box to restart your bot only when it's needed. Changes made to commands/events files are automatically reloaded without restarting the bot. CommandKit automatically loads your environment variables from `.env` file in your project directory, without you having to worry about it. It also supports typescript out of the box.

### Production

`commandkit start` starts your bot in production mode. You need to run `commandkit build` before running this command. This command also loads the environment variables from `.env` file in your project directory.

### Create

`commandkit create` creates new commands, events, or locale files. You can use this command to quickly scaffold new files in your project.
