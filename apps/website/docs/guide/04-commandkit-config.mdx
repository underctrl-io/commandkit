description: Learn how to configure CommandKit CLI for your project.
---

CommandKit CLI can be configured using `commandkit.config` file in the root of your project directory (for example, by `package.json`). You can use either of the following files:

- `commandkit.config.js`
- `commandkit.config.mjs`
- `commandkit.config.cjs`
- `commandkit.config.ts`

Throughout this guide, we'll be using `commandkit.config.ts` as an example.

The following is the sample configuration required to run your bot:

```js title="commandkit.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';

export default defineConfig({});
```

## Options

The following options are available in the configuration file:

- `plugins`: An array of commandkit plugins to use in your project. CommandKit plugins may add compile time or runtime features to your project.
- `esbuildPlugins`: An array of esbuild plugins to use in your project. This is useful if you want to use esbuild plugins in your project.
- `compilerOptions`: An object containing compiler options for your project.
- `compilerOptions.macro.development`: When set to `true`, it enables macro compilation during development.
- `compilerOptions.cache.development`: When set to `true`, it enables `use cache` directive during development.
- `distDir`: The output directory for the build. By default, it is set to `dist`.
- `env`: An object containing static environment variables definitions.
- `typedCommands`: A boolean value that enables type definitions generation for commands during development.
- `typedLocales`: A boolean value that enables locales autocompletion during development.
