development tools and utilities designed to enhance your CommandKit
development experience. It includes features like command inspection,
performance monitoring, debugging tools, and a web-based interface for
managing your Discord bot during development.

:::warning

This plugin is currently in early development and may not be fully
stable. It is recommended to use it for testing and feedback purposes
only. Features and APIs may change in future releases.

:::

## Features

- **Command Inspection**: View and analyze all registered commands in
  your bot
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track command execution times and
  performance metrics
- **Debugging Tools**: Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based dashboard for managing your bot
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates of bot status and metrics
- **Development Utilities**: Additional tools to streamline
  development workflow

## Installation

Install the devtools plugin using your preferred package manager:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @commandkit/devtools@dev
```

:::info

Currently, the devtools plugin is only available as a development
version. Use the `@dev` tag when installing to get the latest
development build.

:::

## Setup

Add the devtools plugin to your CommandKit configuration:

```ts title="commandkit.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';
import { devtools } from '@commandkit/devtools';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [devtools()],
});
```

That's it! The devtools plugin will automatically start when you run
your application in development mode.

## Using the devtools

Once the plugin is installed and configured, the devtools interface
will be available at `http://localhost:4356` when you start your
application with `commandkit dev`.

```bash
npx commandkit dev
```

The web interface provides access to all devtools features and allows
you to:

- Monitor your bot's status and performance
- Inspect registered commands and their configurations
- View real-time logs and debug information
- Access development utilities and tools

## Configuration options

The devtools plugin accepts several configuration options to customize
its behavior:

```ts title="commandkit.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';
import { devtools } from '@commandkit/devtools';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    devtools({
      // Custom port for the devtools interface
      port: 4356,

      // Enable or disable specific features
      features: {
        commandInspection: true,
        performanceMonitoring: true,
        debugging: true,
      },

      // Additional configuration options
      enableLogging: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Configuration properties

- `port` (number): The port number for the devtools web interface
  (default: `4356`)
- `features` (object): Enable or disable specific devtools features
- `enableLogging` (boolean): Enable enhanced logging capabilities

## Development workflow

The devtools plugin integrates seamlessly with CommandKit's
development workflow:

1. **Start Development**: Run `commandkit dev` to start your bot in
   development mode
2. **Access Devtools**: Open `http://localhost:4356` in your browser
3. **Monitor & Debug**: Use the web interface to monitor your bot and
   debug issues
4. **Hot Reload**: Make changes to your code and see updates in
   real-time

:::tip Development Only

The devtools plugin is designed for development use only and should
not be included in production builds. Consider using environment-based
configuration to conditionally include the plugin:

```ts title="commandkit.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';
import { devtools } from '@commandkit/devtools';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // Only include devtools in development
    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? [devtools()] : []),
  ],
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

If port `4356` is already in use, you can specify a different port in
the configuration:

```ts
devtools({ port: 4357 });
```

### Interface not loading

Ensure that:

1. The devtools plugin is properly configured
2. Your application is running in development mode
3. No firewall is blocking the specified port
4. You're accessing the correct URL (`http://localhost:4356`)

### Performance issues

If you experience performance issues:

1. Disable unnecessary features in the configuration
2. Reduce logging verbosity
3. Consider using a different port
