:::danger

This plugin is not recommended as we do not plan to continue
supporting the legacy structure. We only recommend this if you're
trying to incrementally upgrade your application. If you prefer the
old way, you can use v0.1.10, but please note, that version is not
actively maintained.

:::

The `@commandkit/legacy` plugin enables support for legacy command and
event handlers. This is particularly useful when migrating from an
older version of CommandKit or another framework, as it allows you to
incrementally upgrade your application without requiring immediate
major changes to your existing code.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @commandkit/legacy@next
```

## Usage

Add the Legacy plugin to your CommandKit configuration:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';
import { legacy } from '@commandkit/legacy';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [legacy()],
});
```

## Features

The Legacy plugin provides the following features:

1. **Legacy Command Handler Support**: Enables support for older
   command handler formats, making migration easier.

2. **Legacy Event Handler Support**: Allows you to continue using your
   existing event handler structure.

3. **Legacy Validation Support**: Maintains compatibility with
   existing validation methods.

4. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: The plugin automatically enables
   HMR for legacy commands, events, and validations, improving the
   development experience by allowing you to see changes without
   restarting your bot.

## Migration Strategy

The Legacy plugin is designed as a transitional tool. While it allows
you to continue using your existing code structure, it's recommended
to gradually migrate your commands, events, and validators to the new
CommandKit format over time.

This approach enables you to:

1. Upgrade your bot's framework immediately without breaking existing
   functionality
2. Incrementally refactor your code at your own pace
3. Take advantage of new CommandKit features for new commands while
   maintaining backward compatibility
