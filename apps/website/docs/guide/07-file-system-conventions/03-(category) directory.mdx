Category directories are special directories inside `src/app/commands`, with `(<categoryName>)` as their name. The `(category)` directory is used to group related commands together. This is useful for organizing your commands into logical groups, making it easier to manage and maintain your code. This directory has no effect on the command execution, but it is a good practice to use it to keep your code organized. You can nest multiple `(category)` directories to create a hierarchy of commands. For example, you can have a `fun` directory with a `jokes` subdirectory, and inside the `jokes` subdirectory, you can have multiple command files related to jokes.
