The `src/app/locales` directory is managed by the [@commandkit/i18n](../06-plugins/official-plugins/02-i18n.mdx) plugin. This directory can be used to store the translation files for your commands. The translation files should be named according to the locale they represent. For example, if you have a translation file for `ping` command in English, you should name it `src/app/locales/en-US/ping.json`.

The translation file contains one special key called `$command`, which is used to define the localization for the command. CommandKit will automatically merge these localizations before registering the command. The `$command` object looks similar to the shape of a typical interaction command. The following example shows how to define the localization for the `ping` command in English:

```json title="src/app/locales/en-US/ping.json"
{
  "$command": {
    "name": "ping",
    "description": "Ping command",
    "options": [
      {
        "name": "verbose",
        "description": "Show verbose output"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The below is an example of a typical translation file for the `ping` command in English:

```json title="src/app/locales/en/ping.json"
{
  "$command": {
    "name": "ping",
    "description": "Ping command",
    "options": [
      {
        "name": "verbose",
        "description": "Show verbose output"
      }
    ]
  },
  "success": "Pong! {{ping}}ms"
}
```

Then you can use the `t` function to get the translation for the current command. The `t` function is returned by the `ctx.locale()` function.

```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
import { CommandData } from 'commandkit';
import { ApplicationCommandOptionType } from 'discord.js';

export const command: CommandData = {
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Ping command',
  options: [
    {
      name: 'verbose',
      description: 'Show verbose output',
      type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.Boolean,
    },
  ],
};

export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
  const ping = Date.now() - ctx.interaction.createdTimestamp;
  const verbose = ctx.interaction.options.getBoolean('verbose', false);
  // locale is auto inferred from the interaction if not specified
  const { t } = ctx.locale();

  const response = t('success', { ping });

  if (verbose) {
    response += `\nVerbose: true`;
  }

  await ctx.interaction.reply(response);
};
```
