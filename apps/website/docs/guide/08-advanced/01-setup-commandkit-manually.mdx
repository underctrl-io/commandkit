import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

If you don't want to use the
[CLI](../01-getting-started/02-setup-commandkit.mdx) to automatically
generate a base CommandKit project, you can integrate CommandKit
manually into your application.

## Installation

To install CommandKit, you can use the following command:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install commandkit@next
```

## Configuration file

To get started, create a configuration file at the root of your
project. This file is used to configure CommandKit and optionally its
plugins.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```ts title="commandkit.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';

    export default defineConfig({});
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="commandkit.config.js"
    import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';

    export default defineConfig({});
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Entrypoint file

Then, create a folder called `src`, followed by an app file inside it.
The file should look like this:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```ts title="src/app.ts"
    import { Client } from 'discord.js';

    const client = new Client({
      intents: ['Guilds'],
    });

    client.token = '...'; // Optional: Manually set a bot token

    export default client;
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/app.js"
    import { Client } from 'discord.js';

    const client = new Client({
      intents: ['Guilds'],
    });

    client.token = '...'; // Optional: Manually set a bot token

    export default client;
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With the current entrypoint file created, it's important to understand
that:

1. The `app.ts` file is the entrypoint for this application. This file
   **must** export your discord.js client instance.
2. You don't have to call `client.login()` as CommandKit will handle
   that for you.
3. You should store your bot token as an environment variable with
   either `DISCORD_TOKEN` or `TOKEN` as the name.
4. If you prefer to have a custom environment variable for your bot
   token, you can manually assign it to the `client.token` property.

## Adding commands

To add a command, create a folder inside the `src/app` directory
called `commands` and create your command file. This example will use
a simple ping/pong command which will register as a chat input (slash)
and message command.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```ts title="src/app/commands/ping.ts"
    import type { ChatInputCommand, CommandData, MessageCommand } from 'commandkit';

    export const command: CommandData = {
      name: 'ping',
      description: 'Pong!',
    };

    export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async ({ interaction }) => {
      await interaction.reply('Pong!');
    };

    export const message: MessageCommand = async ({ message }) => {
      await message.reply('Pong!');
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/app/commands/ping.js"
    /**
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').ChatInputCommand} ChatInputCommand
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').CommandData} CommandData
     * @typedef {import('commandkit').MessageCommand} MessageCommand
     */

    /** @type {CommandData} */
    export const command = {
      name: 'ping',
      description: 'Pong!',
    };

    /** @type {ChatInputCommand} */
    export const chatInput = async ({ interaction }) => {
      await interaction.reply('Pong!');
    };

    /** @type {MessageCommand} */
    export const message = async ({ message }) => {
      await message.reply('Pong!');
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will reply with "Pong!" when the user runs the `/ping`
slash command, or sends `!ping` in the chat.

:::tip

The prefix for message commands can be changed globally or per-guild.

## Adding events

To register and handle events emitted by your discord.js client,
create a folder inside the `src/app` directory called `events` and
create a folder with the name of the discord.js event you'd like to
handle (e.g. clientReady, messageCreate, etc). This example will use
the `clientReady` event.

In the `src/app/events/clientReady` directory, you can create files
which will export default functions that will be called when the
respective event is emitted by discord.js. Following the `clientReady`
event example mentioned above, you may want to log when your bot comes
online. The function for that will look like so:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>
    ```ts title="src/app/events/clientReady/log.ts"
    import type { Client } from 'discord.js';

    export default function (client: Client<true>) {
      console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.username}!`);
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/app/events/clientReady/log.js"
    /**
     * Event handler for when the bot is ready
     * @param {import('discord.js').Client<true>} client - The Discord client instance
     */
    export default function (client) {
      console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.username}!`);
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

You can find a full list of events under the
[discord.js Client class](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/Client:Class).

## Running the app in development

To run your application in development mode, you can use the
`commandkit dev` command in your terminal. This will allow you to
quickly reload specific parts of your application using Hot Module
Replacement (HMR) when you make changes to your code, without having
to restart the entire application.

```sh npm2yarn
npx commandkit dev
```

:::warning

When running in development mode, CommandKit will generate a
`.commandkit` folder in the root of your project. This folder contains
the compiled files used in development mode. You should not commit
this folder to your version control system by making sure you add it
to your `.gitignore` file.

:::

## Building for production

When you are ready to deploy your bot, you can use `commandkit build`
to create a production build of your bot. This will create a `dist`
folder in your project directory containing the compiled files.

```sh
npx commandkit build
```

:::warning

After running your build script, CommandKit will generate a `dist`
folder in the root of your project. This folder contains the compiled
files used for production. You should not commit this folder to your
version control system by making sure you add it to your `.gitignore`
file.

:::

## Running the app in production

You can use `commandkit start` to start the bot in production mode.
This will load the environment variables from the `.env` file in the
root of your project directory.

```sh
npx commandkit start
```

Alternatively, you can manually start the bot in production mode using
a runtime environment of your choice:

```sh
node dist/index.js
```
