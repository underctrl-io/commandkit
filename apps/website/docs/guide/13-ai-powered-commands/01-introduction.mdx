## Introduction

CommandKit's `@commandkit/ai` plugin allows you to execute your bot commands using large language models. This enables you to use your bot's features entirely through natural language.

:::warning
This is an experimental feature and is subject to change.
:::

## Installation

```bash
npm install @commandkit/ai
```

You also need to install the AI SDK for the model you want to use. For example, if you want to use Google Gemini, you can install the `@ai-sdk/google` package:

```bash
npm install @ai-sdk/google
```

Refer to the [AI SDKs documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev) for more information on how to set up the AI SDK for your model.

## Usage

```typescript title="commandkit.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'commandkit';
import { ai } from '@commandkit/ai';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [ai()],
});
```
