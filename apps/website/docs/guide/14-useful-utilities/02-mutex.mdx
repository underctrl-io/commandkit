  Ensure exclusive access to shared resources with async mutex locks

# Mutex

A mutex is like a "do not disturb" sign for your data. It ensures that
only one operation can access a shared resource at a time. Imagine
multiple people trying to edit the same document - a mutex makes sure
only one person can edit it at once.

## Basic Usage

The easiest way to use a mutex is with the `withMutex` function, which
automatically handles locking and unlocking:

```typescript
import { withMutex } from 'commandkit/mutex';

// This ensures only one operation can update the shared resource at a time
const result = await withMutex('shared-resource', async () => {
  // This code runs with exclusive access
  return await updateSharedResource();
});
```

## Custom Configuration

You can create a custom mutex with different timeout settings:

```typescript
import { createMutex } from 'commandkit/mutex';

const mutex = createMutex({
  timeout: 60000, // 60 second timeout
});

const result = await mutex.withLock('resource', async () => {
  return await criticalOperation();
});
```

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Lock Management

Sometimes you need more control over when locks are acquired and
released:

```typescript
import { acquireLock, releaseLock, isLocked } from 'commandkit/mutex';

// Acquire lock manually
const acquired = await acquireLock('resource', 30000);
if (acquired) {
  try {
    // Perform critical operation
    await criticalOperation();
  } finally {
    // Always release the lock, even if an error occurs
    await releaseLock('resource');
  }
}

// Check if resource is currently locked
const locked = await isLocked('resource');
console.log(`Resource is ${locked ? 'locked' : 'available'}`);
```

### Cancelling Operations

You can cancel a mutex operation if it takes too long or if you need
to stop it for any reason:

```typescript
import { withMutex } from 'commandkit/mutex';

// Create a timeout that cancels after 5 seconds
const signal = AbortSignal.timeout(5000);

try {
  const result = await withMutex(
    'resource',
    async () => {
      return await longRunningOperation();
    },
    30000,
    signal,
  );
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('aborted')) {
    console.log('Lock acquisition was cancelled');
  }
}
```

### Using External Storage

By default, mutexes store lock information in memory. If you're
running multiple servers, you'll want to use external storage like
Redis:

```typescript
import { Mutex, MutexStorage } from 'commandkit/mutex';
import { RedisMutexStorage } from '@commandkit/redis';
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';

// Create Redis client
const redis = new Redis();

// Use Redis-based mutex storage
const mutex = new Mutex({
  timeout: 30000,
  storage: new RedisMutexStorage(redis),
});
```

You can also use the convenience function:

```typescript
import { createMutex } from 'commandkit/mutex';
import { RedisMutexStorage } from '@commandkit/redis';

const mutex = createMutex({
  timeout: 60000,
  storage: new RedisMutexStorage(redis),
});
```

## Default Settings

- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (30000ms)
- **Storage**: In-memory (works for single-server applications)

## Common Use Cases

- **Database Transactions**: Ensure only one operation can modify data
  at a time
- **File System Access**: Prevent multiple operations from writing to
  the same file
- **Configuration Updates**: Make sure configuration changes don't
  conflict
- **Cache Invalidation**: Control when cache is cleared to prevent
  race conditions
- **Resource Pool Management**: Manage access to limited resources

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Use `withMutex` When Possible**: It automatically handles
   cleanup, so you don't forget to release locks
2. **Set Reasonable Timeouts**: Don't make timeouts too short (might
   fail unnecessarily) or too long (might hang forever)
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Give your resources meaningful names
   like `user:123:profile` or `database:users`
4. **Handle Errors**: Always handle cases where lock acquisition fails
5. **Think About Deadlocks**: Be careful not to create situations
   where two operations wait for each other
6. **Consider Your Setup**: Use external storage if you have multiple
   servers
