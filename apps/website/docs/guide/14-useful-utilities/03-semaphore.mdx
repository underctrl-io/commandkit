# Semaphore

A semaphore is like a parking lot with a limited number of spaces. It
allows a specific number of operations to happen at the same time, but
no more. Perfect for controlling access to limited resources like
database connections.

## Basic Usage

The easiest way to use a semaphore is with the `withPermit` function,
which automatically handles getting and releasing permits:

```typescript
import { withPermit } from 'commandkit/semaphore';

// This ensures only a limited number of operations can run at once
const result = await withPermit('database-connection', async () => {
  // This code runs with a permit from the semaphore
  return await executeDatabaseQuery();
});
```

## Custom Configuration

You can create a semaphore with specific limits and timeout settings:

```typescript
import { createSemaphore } from 'commandkit/semaphore';

const semaphore = createSemaphore({
  permits: 5, // Allow 5 concurrent operations
  timeout: 60000, // 60 second timeout
});

const result = await semaphore.withPermit(
  'api-endpoint',
  async () => {
    return await apiCall();
  },
);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Permit Management

Sometimes you need more control over when permits are acquired and
released:

```typescript
import {
  acquirePermit,
  releasePermit,
  getAvailablePermits,
} from 'commandkit/semaphore';

// Acquire permit manually
const acquired = await acquirePermit('resource', 30000);
if (acquired) {
  try {
    // Perform operation with limited concurrency
    await limitedOperation();
  } finally {
    // Always release the permit, even if an error occurs
    await releasePermit('resource');
  }
}

// Check how many permits are available
const available = await getAvailablePermits('resource');
console.log(`${available} permits available`);
```

### Cancelling Operations

You can cancel a semaphore operation if it takes too long or if you
need to stop it for any reason:

```typescript
import { withPermit } from 'commandkit/semaphore';

// Create a timeout that cancels after 5 seconds
const signal = AbortSignal.timeout(5000);

try {
  const result = await withPermit(
    'resource',
    async () => {
      return await longRunningOperation();
    },
    30000,
    signal,
  );
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('aborted')) {
    console.log('Permit acquisition was cancelled');
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Semaphore State

You can check how many permits are being used and how many are
available:

```typescript
import {
  getAvailablePermits,
  getAcquiredPermits,
} from 'commandkit/semaphore';

const available = await getAvailablePermits('database');
const acquired = await getAcquiredPermits('database');

console.log(
  `Database connections: ${acquired} active, ${available} available`,
);
```

### Using External Storage

By default, semaphores store permit information in memory. If you're
running multiple servers, you'll want to use external storage like
Redis:

```typescript
import { Semaphore, SemaphoreStorage } from 'commandkit/semaphore';
import { RedisSemaphoreStorage } from '@commandkit/redis';
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';

// Create Redis client
const redis = new Redis();

// Use Redis-based semaphore storage
const semaphore = new Semaphore({
  permits: 10,
  timeout: 30000,
  storage: new RedisSemaphoreStorage(redis),
});
```

You can also use the convenience function:

```typescript
import { createSemaphore } from 'commandkit/semaphore';
import { RedisSemaphoreStorage } from '@commandkit/redis';

const semaphore = createSemaphore({
  permits: 5,
  timeout: 60000,
  storage: new RedisSemaphoreStorage(redis),
});
```

## Default Settings

- **Permits**: 1 (sequential access)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (30000ms)
- **Storage**: In-memory (works for single-server applications)

## Common Use Cases

- **Database Connection Pooling**: Limit how many database connections
  are used at once
- **API Rate Limiting with Concurrency**: Allow multiple API calls but
  not too many
- **File Upload Throttling**: Control how many files can be uploaded
  simultaneously
- **External Service Access**: Limit calls to third-party services
- **Resource Pool Management**: Manage access to limited resources
  like memory or CPU

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Use `withPermit` When Possible**: It automatically handles
   cleanup, so you don't forget to release permits
2. **Set Appropriate Limits**: Don't set too many permits (might
   overwhelm resources) or too few (might be too slow)
3. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on how many permits are being used
   to optimize performance
4. **Use Descriptive Names**: Give your resources meaningful names
   like `database:main` or `api:external`
5. **Handle Errors**: Always handle cases where permit acquisition
   fails
6. **Consider Your Resources**: Set permit limits based on what your
   system can actually handle
7. **Think About Your Setup**: Use external storage if you have
   multiple servers
