# Message Queue

The CommandKit Queue package provides a service-agnostic message queue
API for inter-service communication. It allows you to send and receive
messages between different parts of your application or across
multiple services using a simple, unified interface.

## Features

- **Service Agnostic**: Works with any message queue implementation
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use `send` and `receive` functions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strong typing
- **Driver System**: Pluggable drivers for different queue backends
- **Discord.js Integration**: Built-in support for Discord.js brokers
- **Redis Support**: Ready-to-use Redis PubSub driver

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { setDriver } from '@commandkit/queue';
import { RedisPubSubDriver } from '@commandkit/queue/discordjs';
import { PubSubRedisBroker } from '@discordjs/brokers';
import Redis from 'ioredis';

// Set up the driver
const broker = new PubSubRedisBroker(new Redis());
const driver = new RedisPubSubDriver(broker);
setDriver(driver);

// Send a message
import { send } from '@commandkit/queue';
await send('user-updates', { userId: '123', action: 'login' });

// Receive messages
import { receive } from '@commandkit/queue';
await receive('user-updates', (message) => {
  console.log(`User ${message.userId} performed ${message.action}`);
});
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install @commandkit/queue
```

For Discord.js integration with Redis:

```bash
npm install @commandkit/queue @discordjs/brokers ioredis
```

## Core Concepts

### Topics

Topics are named channels where messages are sent and received. Think
of them as categories or channels for different types of messages.

### Messages

Messages can be any JSON-serializable data. They're sent to topics and
received by subscribers.

### Drivers

Drivers are implementations that handle the actual message queue
backend. CommandKit provides a unified API that works with any driver.

## Use Cases

- **Inter-Service Communication**: Send messages between different
  parts of your application
- **Event Broadcasting**: Broadcast events to multiple subscribers
- **Task Distribution**: Distribute work across multiple workers
- **Real-time Updates**: Send real-time updates to connected clients
- **Microservices**: Enable communication between microservices
