The `after()` function is a utility function that allows you to execute a callback after the current command has been executed. This is useful for performing actions that should occur after the command has completed, such as logging or cleanup tasks.
It is guaranteed to be called after the command has been executed, regardless of whether the command was successful or not.

## Usage

```ts
import { after, ChatInputCommand } from "commandkit";

export const chatInput: ChatInputCommand = async (ctx) => {
    after(() => {
        // This code will be executed after the command has been executed
        console.log("Command has been executed");
    });

    await ctx.interaction.reply({
        content: "Hello World",
        ephemeral: true
    });
}
```
